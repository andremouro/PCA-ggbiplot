Basic PCA analysis and plot with ggbiplot. Some simple modifications of plot aesthetics are demonstrated, as well as the interpretation of data.
This example used the data PlantAtr.csv, which shows the values of litter traits for 10 plant species that occurs in Brazilian Cerrado. The plant species are grouped by its occurrence (Savanna or Forest).
For more information about the data, refers to the following paper:
